Project for training purposes

We need to develop an internet resource for a fan server of a
well-known MMORPG, similar to a bulletin board. Users of our 
resource should be able to register on it via email and receive
a registration confirmation code. After registration, they gain
the ability to create and edit advertisements. Advertisements
consist of a title and text, with the possibility of including
images, embedded videos, and other content. Users can submit
responses to other users' advertisements in plain text. When
submitting a response, the user should receive an email 
notification about it. Additionally, the user should have access
to a private page displaying responses to their advertisements,
where they can filter responses by advertisement, delete them,
and accept them (when accepting a response, the user who submitted
the response should also receive a notification). Furthermore,
users must categorize their advertisements into one of the
following categories: Tanks, Healers, DPS, Traders, Guild Masters,
Quest Givers, Blacksmiths, Leatherworkers, Alchemists, Spell Masters.

Additionally, we would like to have the ability to send newsletters
to users.
